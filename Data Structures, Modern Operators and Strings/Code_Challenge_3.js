// Coding Challenge #3
// Let's continue with our football betting app! This time, we have a map called
// 'gameEvents' (see below) with a log of the events that happened during the
// game. The values are the events themselves, and the keys are the minutes in which
// each event happened (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no
// duplicates)
// 2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64
// was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
// 3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on
// average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
// 4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking
// whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
// [FIRST HALF] 17: ⚽ GOAL
